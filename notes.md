Dataset used for testing: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhankumar789/crop-yield-and-environmental-factors-2014-2023
This dataset contains Crop Type, Soil Type, Soil pH, Temperature(C), Humidity, Wind Speed, N (Nitrogen content in ppm), P (Phosphorus content in ppm), K (Potassium content in ppm), Crop Yield, and Soil Quality

Initial observations:
There is a clear correlation between Crop yield and Temperature, Above 15C and below 30C appears to be the sweet spot.
Phosphorus is directly correlated to Crop yield, more P = more yield.
